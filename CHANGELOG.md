# Change Log

All notable changes to `flutter-stylizer` will be documented in
this file.

Please make sure you have a backup (preferably in git) of your code before running
`flutter-stylizer` in case it doesn't handle your code properly.

## [0.1.1] - 2021-04-26

- Initial release. This version was successfully run on the Flutter code base
  and should be ready for use.

## [v0.0.20-broken] - 2021-04-22

- This was a port of the VSCode `flutter-stylizer` extension that
  I wrote in TypeScript. It turns out that the port had a lot of
  problems. Please disregard and don't use.
